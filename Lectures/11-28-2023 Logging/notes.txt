Logging

5 - Trace/Diagnostics
Log EVERYTHING, methods starting/stopping, return values from functions, timings of methods

4 - Debug
Where do you think your code MIGHT fail?

3 - Information
A user thing happened, a controller finshed running, a row was created in the database

2 - Warning
Not actual problem yet, but could be

1 - Error
An actual problem, usually an exception is thrown

0 - Crtical
Entire server failure, perhaps not even able to boot up


-1 Failure Audit
Someone tried to login that isn't authorized

Why do we have numerical values associated with these levels?
Able to query, read logs by level easily, i.e. all logs less than 3

Logging Costs
1. Storage
    How long do we keep logs?
    Depends on level, the lower the number, the longer we keep it, in general 30-90 days

2. CPU
    Logging could be done as async, i.e. fire and forget
    Disable expensive logging in normal operations


What do we log?
    PII
        ip address of the user
        usernames/passwords
        JWT
        email address


    user id (from their JWT)

    previous values of database rows/memory/etc.

    URL, NOT SAS urls (safe-list query string parameters)
    HTTP Methods (GET, POST, etc.)
    Headers    
        timestamps
        api-version
        request-id
    Response code


Answer 1:
    Come up with 2 examples for each of the above categories from assignments we done.

Answer 2:
    False positives vs. false negatives?
    Which is worse?
